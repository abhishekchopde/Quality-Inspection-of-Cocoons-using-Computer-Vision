# Quality-Inspection-of-Cocoons-using-Computer-Vision
This project aims at inspecting the quality and the quantity of silk inside cocoons using computer vision. It establishes the relationship between physical parameters (area,volume,perimeter) and quantity of silk inside a cocoon shell. It also aims at classifying the cocoons based on their texture quality. At the end of this project we concluded quality of silk inside a cocoon shell depends on the quality of the texture.
